\subsection*{Project Title}
Dahl Virtual Museum Tour

\subsection*{Company}
Dahl Arts Center

\section*{Customer Overview}
\hrulefill
\subsection*{Customer Description}
The Dahl Arts Center is the main source of paintings, sculptures, and other forms of made or found art in Rapid City.

\subsection*{Customer Problem}
The problem that the Dahl has is it's lack of community outreach.  It can be hard for children and students in lower income areas, especially on reservations, to come and visit the Dahl.  They need a method for bringing the art out into the community without compromising the actual art pieces.

\subsection*{Customer Needs}
\begin{itemize}
\item A virtual recreation of an art gallery (to be determined by the Dahl)
\item A guided tour of the art gallery
\item Simple menu system to choose which type of tour (guided, or free-moving if finished)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Project Overview}
\hrulefill
\subsection*{Phase 1}
The first phase will be getting the guided tour operational.  This is the main product that the Dahl wants, so it is the top priority.  Other research or features will come in phase 2 after the main product is finished.

\subsection*{Phase 2}
Here will be where most of the additional features will be implemented based on how much time is allowed.  Things like: alternate environments, free-moving tours, and other ideas yet to be thought of.

\section*{Project Environment}
\hrulefill
\subsection*{Project Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}
\item Will only encompass one art gallery
\item Any movement restraints to reduce nausea
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Project Context}
