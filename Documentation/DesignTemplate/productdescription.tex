The product being designed in this project will be a virtual reality museum tour of an art gallery from the Dahl Arts Center.  The gallery will be the Ruth Brennan Gallery featuring works from artist Arthur Amiotte.  The gallery will be recreated in the Unreal Engine using an Oculus Rift DK2 for virtual reality support.  

There will be two different tour choices, free movement (meaning the user can move around the gallery freely), and on-rails where the user can move between predetermined points.  Movement will be controlled by either mouse and keyboard or by using an Xbox 360 wired controller, depending on user preference.

There will also be text descriptions of each art piece that will be able to be viewed.  These will be interpretive descriptions written by the artist himself and will be placed along with the corresponding art piece.
