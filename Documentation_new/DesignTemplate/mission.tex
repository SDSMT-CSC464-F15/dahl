\section{Mission Statement}
The purpose of this project is to develop a virtual reality environment that accurately represents the Ruth Brennan art exhibit at the Dahl Arts Center.  The end product will be able to be transported to and from the museum too allow students and others, who otherwise cannot visit the museum, to experience the Dahl.

\section{Elevator Pitch}
The Dahl Arts Center would like to have the ability to bring their art galleries outside the museum to the community.  In order to do this, a virtual reality gallery will be constructed to assess the viability of using this method as a means of taking the art out of the museum.
