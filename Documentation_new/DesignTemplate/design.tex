\chapter{Design  and Implementation}
%%This section is used to describe the design details for each of the major components 
%%in the system.    Note that this chapter is critical for all tracks.  Research tracks would do experimental design here where other tracks would include the engineering design aspects.    This section is not brief and requires the necessary detail that 
%%can be used by the reader to truly understand the architecture and implementation 
%details without having to dig into the code.    Sample algorithm:  Algorithm~\ref{alg1}.  This algorithm environment is automatically placed - meaning it floats.   You don't have to worry about placement or numbering.  
The Dahl Virtual Museum project will be done entirely in the Unreal Engine 4.0 using the built in Blueprint system (a visual scripting IDE).  This system provides powerful premade code segments that can be linked together in many ways, there will be images of this system in action later in the document.  The Blueprint system may not be able to cover everything that the project requires, so to make up for that, C++ code can be directly integrated into the Engine as well.  

This section will detail the different aspects of the Blueprints that will constitute the code of this project.  There will be screenshots of the blueprints of each aspect of the project, which are: movement(free and on-rails), the room, the paintings, text descriptions, and alternate environments. 
 


%Citations look like~\cite{Choset:2005:PRM, arkin2009governing, lavalle2006}  and~\cite{wiki:asimo,lumelsky:1987, nolfi2000evolutionary}.  These are done automatically.  Just fill in the database {\tt designrefs.bib} using the same field structure as the other entries.  Then pdflatex the document, bibtex the document and pdflatex twice again.  The first pdflatex creates requests for bibliography entries.
%The bibtex extracts and formats the requested entries.  The next pdflatex puts them in order and assigns labels.  The final pdflatex replaces references in the text with the assigned labels.
%The bibliography is automatically constructed.  
 
 \section{Architecture and System Design}
 The architecture and system diagrams will one and the same, and should be fairly self-explanatory.  
 The Unreal Engine 4.0 that was used for this project is very capable and already had Oculus Rift integration, which helped focus the development on the user experience and visual quality rather than getting the hardware to work together.  Installing the Oculus Rift drivers and associated software was a large chunk of sprint 1.

 \subsection{Design Selection}
 There were a number of ways to do this project, with other graphics engines or virtual reality headsets.  The reason the Unreal Engine was chosen was because of its almost seamless integration of the Oculus Rift SDK2.  As for the Oculus Rift, that was chosen because there was an available SDK2 from Nick Newell at Echostar who graciously lent the dev kit to the design team to use.  
 
 \subsection{Data Structures and Algorithms}
 The Unreal Engine employs a number of objects that have different attributes associated with them. This section will go over the objects used in this project and why they were chosen.

 \subsection{Communications}
 This section will explain how each object interacts with the others, for instance how the waypoint system for the On-rails movement works.

\section{ Movement }

\subsection{Technologies  Used}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Unreal Engine Blueprint
	\item Oculus Rift
	\item Keyboard and mouse
	\item Xbox 360 wired controller
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Component  Overview}

% SHOULD REVISE THIS SECTION
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Free movement:  User can freely move throughout the environment
	\item On-rails:  User travels from painting to painting along a linear path
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Phase Overview}
%This is an extension of the Phase Overview above, but specific to this component. 
% It is meant to be basically a brief list with space for marking the phase status.

\subsection{Design Details}
The movement methods are a key feature to this product.  Without a good movement system, the user will not feel immersed in the gallery and will detract from the experience.  The reason for two different methods is that the design team felt that on-rails would be a better fit for users who are inexperienced with virtual reality or handheld controller input.  The free-movement will be a better fit for people who have experience with virtual reality, or computer graphics in general.

%Should probably add more to this section



\section{Paintings }

\subsection{Technologies  Used}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unreal Engine 4.0 Blueprint system
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Component  Overview}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Painting image files (.png)
\item Painting texture files
\item UE objects with textures attached
\end{enumerate}

%\subsection{Phase Overview}
%I'm not exactly sure what to put for this or any of the phase overviews

\subsection{Design Details}
This was a tedious process due to the fact that every file had to be converted from .jpg to .png in order for them to work in the engine.  Then was the task of making the objects in the right dimension for each painting which was done by making box objects to scale with the width and height of each painting, then dragging the .png file onto the object itself thereby creating the texture.


\section{Gallery }

\subsection{Technologies  Used}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Unreal Engine 4.0
\item Measuring Tape
\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Component  Overview}
The gallery itself was fairly easy to generate.  A blueprint of the actual room was provided by the Dahl and make rendering the Unreal Engine as simple as make the right sized objects.  The four outer walls were very easy to generate from the blueprint, the two protruding walls had to be measured by hand. The rounded corners however were more difficult to recreate because there are no rounded walls in the Unreal Engine, so they had to be custom made.

\subsection{Design Details}
This section is about how the actual room was recreated in the Unreal Engine.  The Dahl provided a blueprint of the room which gave the dimensions and angles of the corners which was helpful in mapping it into the engine.  A measuring tape was used for the standalone walls that protrude into the room and the measurements were then scaled to the Unreal Engine unit system.

\section{Text Descriptions}

\subsection{Technologies Used}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Unreal Engine 4.0
	\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Component Overview}
The text descriptions as described in the user stories, are interpretive excerpts written by the artist Arthur Amiotte that give insight into the meaning behind the piece.  The way the design team implemented these descriptions in the gallery is by using small rectangular objects that expand when the user is looking at the painting, in order to provide ease of reading, and then shrink back down when the user moves on.  The actual text that will appear on this object will come from a .png file and just like the paintings, be applied to in-gallery objects.

\subsection{Design Details}
This component was designed very similarly to the paintings, in that the method of applying this "text-texture" to the in-gallery objects was the same.  The main difference between the two, is the enlarging and shrinking of the object.  This was done using a blueprint in the Unreal Engine Blueprint editor, the blueprint itself can be viewed above in the Data Flow Diagram section.
