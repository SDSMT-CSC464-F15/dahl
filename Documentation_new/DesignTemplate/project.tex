\chapter{Project Overview}
%This section provides some housekeeping type of information with regard to the 
%team, project, environment, etc. 



\section{Team Member's Roles}
%Describe who was involved and what role(s) were played. 
For this team Mackenzie Smith is the Project Lead. He will keep in contact with the Dahl, and interpret what they want for the project. Alex Nienhueser will be the Scrum Master. He will who's assigned specific tasks as well as their order.

\section{Project  Management Approach}
%This section will provide an explanation of the basic approach to managing the 
%project.  Typically, this would detail how the project will be managed through 
%a given Agile methodology.  The sprint length (i.e. 2 weeks) and product backlog 
%ownership and location (ex. Trello) are examples of what will be discussed.  An 
%overview of the system used to track sprint tasks, bug or trouble tickets, and 
%user stories would be warranted. 


\section{ Stakeholder Information}
This section would provide the basic description of all of the stakeholders for 
the project.  Who has an interest in the successful and/or unsuccessful completion 
of this project? 


\subsection{Customer or End User (Product Owner)}
The Product owner is the Dahl Arts Center, they will be determining the direction the project go. They will provide feedback on what features should be in this project, as well as user stories.They will be kept up to date by Mackenzie Smith on both the backlog as well as the progress of the project.
%Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will this person or group manage 
%and prioritize the product backlog?  Who will they interact with on the team to 
%drive product backlog priorities if not done directly? 

\subsection{Management or Instructor (Scrum Master)}
The Scrum Master for this project is Alex Nienhueser. He will be determining the order in which key features are to be finished and test. He will also determine Sprint Meeting times. 
%Who?  What role will they play in the project?  Will the Scrum Master drive the 
%Sprint Meetings? 


\subsection{Investors}
For this project there are no current investors. It there is no money going to the this Virtual Gallery.
%Are there any?  Who?  What role will they play? 


\subsection{Developers --Testers}
The developers and designers for this project are both Mackenzie Smith and Alex Nienhueser, wihle the Project Manager is only Mackenzie Smith. Testing will be done via participants of beta testing times done throughout the projects development. These participants will be SDSMT students and faculty. 
%Who?  Is there a defined project manager, developer, tester, designer, architect, 
%etc.? 

\section{Budget}
For this project there is no current budget. Due to the Unreal 4 Engine's libary of textures there is no need to purchase any additional enviorment. 

\section{Intellectual Property and Licensing}
This will be looked further in to in sprint 4.
%Describe the IP ownership and issues surrounding IP.

\section{Sprint  Overview}
This project will be split into seperate six sprints. The goals for each sprint is as follows\\ \\
 \textbf{Sprint1}\\
-Research Oculus and Unreal 4 Engine\\ \\
 \textbf{Sprint2}\\
-Create prototype for on rails movement\\
-Create prototype for free movement\\
-Create prototype of the gallery environment\\ \\
 \textbf{Sprint3}\\
-Finalize both movement types\\
-Finalize the gallery enviornment\\ \\
 \textbf{Sprint4}\\
-Finalize enlarging of painting descriptions\\ \\
 \textbf{Sprint5}\\
-Develope and finalize alternate enviornment\\ \\
 \textbf{Sprint6}\\
-Finish documentation\\ 
-Finish testing\\
-Finish deliverables\\

%If the system will be implemented in phases, describe those phases/sub-phases (design, 
%implementation, testing, delivery) and the various milestones in this section. 
%This section should also contain a correlation between the phases of development 
%and the associated versioning of the system, i.e. major version, minor version, 
%revision. 

%All of the Agile decisions are listed here.  For example, how do you order your backlog?   
%Did you use planning poker?

\section{Timeline}
Gantt chart or other type of visual representation of the project timeline.

\section{Backlogs}
%Place the sprint backlogs here.    The product backlog will be in the chapter with the user 
%stories.

\section{Burndown Charts}
Place your burndown charts, team velocity information, etc here.   


\section{Development Environment}
The development environment for this project is the Unreal 4 Engine. To run this project it will need to be loaded into the Unreal 4 Engine ver 9.2. If version 9.2 can't be downloaded then Unreal 4 has tool to convert the project to any newer version of the software.
%The basic purpose for this section is to give a developer all of the necessary 
%information to setup their development environment to run, test, and/or develop. 


\section{Development IDE and Tools}
The two IDE's used for this project are the Unreal 4 Engine and Visual Studios
%Describe which IDE and provide links to installs and/or reference material. 

\section{Source  Control}
The source control used for this project is GitHub. We had it set up with four current directories. The first being blueprints. This contains all of the blueprints for the Unreal Engine as well as any other code we create or generate. The next directory is Documentation\_new. This contains the newest DesignDocument as well as the project contract. There is a similar directory Documentation\_old which contains the an older version of  Documentation\_new. Finally the last directory, SprintReports, contains report for each sprint for this project.
%Which source control system is/was used?  How was it setup?  How does a developer 
%connect to it? 

\section{Dependencies}
Describe all dependencies associated with developing the system. 

\section{Build  Environment}
The build environment for this project is all handled by the Unreal 4 Engine.
%How are the packages built?  Are there build scripts? 

\section{Development Machine Setup}
For setup the user will need an Oculus Rift. Once it is unpackaged the user will need to plug the hdmi cord from the Oculus headset to their computers graphics card. 
%If warranted, provide a list of steps and details associated with setting up a 
%machine for use by a developer.
