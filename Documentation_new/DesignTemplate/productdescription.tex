The product being designed in this project will be a virtual reality museum tour of an art gallery from the Dahl Arts Center.  The gallery will be the Ruth Brennan Gallery featuring works from artist Arthur Amiotte.  The gallery will be recreated in the Unreal Engine using an Oculus Rift DK2 for virtual reality support.  

There will be two different tour choices, free movement (meaning the user can move around the gallery freely), and on-rails where the user can move between predetermined points.  Movement will be controlled by either mouse and keyboard or by using an Xbox 360 wired controller, depending on user preference.


Other features will include:
\begin{description}
\item Interpretive text descriptions \hfill \\
	These will designed to help the viewer understand the meaning behind the specific painting.  They will be written for a high school reading level, by the artist himself.  Only a few specific painting will receive these descriptions, while every painting will have a short description that are associate with every painting in the Dahl.  These short descriptions include the dimensions of the piece as well as price (if that piece is for sale).
	
\item Alternate Environment \hfill \\
	The alternate environment desired by the Dahl is the Black Hills, due to the significance between it and the author.  This will be an alternate setting in which the gallery will be recreated, to express the possibilities  of virtual reality.
