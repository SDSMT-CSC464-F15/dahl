Before you can use the SDK, you need set up the drivers for your operating system. If your drivers are already set up, please skip to the  section. This content repeats the instructions in the Oculus Rift User Guide. The first thing to do is, download the Oculus Runtime Installer from the Oculus website. The Runtime is available from https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/.
\\ This will install the following components:
\\
\\Oculus Display Driver (Windows Only)
\\ Oculus Positional Tracking Sensor Driver
\\ Oculus Service Application
\\ Oculus System Tray Application and Configuration Utility Windows
\\

\\
\\To install the package:
\\
\\
Download the runtime from https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/. In the Windows Control Panel, go to Programs -> Programs and Features and uninstall any existing components. Run the install executable found in this package. This will install all the components described above and prompt you to restart your computer. Restart your computer. If you want to remove the Runtime package for the current user, run the provided Uninstaller or run the OculusDirectory/Agent/uninstallAgent.sh shell script from the command line.
